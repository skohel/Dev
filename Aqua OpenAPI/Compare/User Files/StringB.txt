Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after opening on Friday.

Friday’s swings came after Senate passed its version of a financial overhaul bill and German lawmakers voted to approve their country’s share of the nearly $1 trillion rescue deal to save the euro and contain the European debt crisis.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell almost immediately below 10,000 as trading opened on Friday but regained that ground and more. At the close, the index was 125.38 points, or 1.25 percent, higher at 10,193.39. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 16.10 points or 1.5 percent, to 1,087.69, and the Nasdaq was 25.03 points or 1.14 percent higher at 2,229.04.

The market volatility index remained high on Friday, and there were signs of pressure in the credit market as 10-year Treasury yields and the three-month interbank lending rate rose.

“Definitely people think we are not out of the woods yet,” said Justin Golden, a senior strategist for Macro Risk Advisors, who said institutional investors at least were awaiting further developments in Europe over the handling of the debt crisis.
